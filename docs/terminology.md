# Terminology

## Word choice

Write in Global and Plain English.

- Don't use words that can be confusing for non-native speakers. For more details, see the [A-Z of alternative words :octicons-tab-external-16:][plain-english-alternative-words]{:target="_blank"} composed by the Plain English Campaign.
- Don't use Latin abbreviations like *e.g.*, *etc.* or *i.e.* Use an English equivalent, like *for example*, *and so on*, or *that is*.
